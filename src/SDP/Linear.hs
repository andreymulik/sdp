  'Linear' is one of the main SDP classes, a class of linear data structures.
  
  A structure of type @l@ must be able to contain an arbitrary ordered dataset
  of type @e@, with arbitrary length. The ordering implies that each @e@ element
  in @l@ can be associated with a non-negative number.
  
  Structures that cannot store, for example, a zero number of elements (e.g.
  'Data.List.NonEmpty.NonEmpty'), or have some static size, aren't 'Linear'.
  
  Of course, the @l@ structure can also have a greater dimension, for example,
  a matrix (of scalar elements) can be 'Linear' if some order is defined for its
  elements. The standard SDP structures use the 'Index' class to define this
  order. You may also want to think of the table as a linear structure
  containing rows/columns, or use a different ordering method such as Gray code.
  
  'Linear' structures must follow some rules:
  
  @
    mempty  === lzero
    mappend === (<>) === (++)
    mconcat === fold === concat
    
    isNull  (single e)   === True
    isNull (toHead x xs) === True
    isNull (toLast xs x) === True
    
    reverse . reverse === id
    listL === reverse . listR === listR . reverse
    listR === reverse . listL === listL . reverse
    
    fromList === fromFoldable
    fromFoldable === foldr toHead Z
    
    -- For 'Foldable' instances:
    length (toHead x xs) === length xs + 1
    length (toLast xs x) === length xs + 1
    
    length (replicate n e) === n
    
    isNull === length == 0
    length === length . listL === length . listR
    toList === listL === reverse . listR === listR . reverse
