[email](mailto:work.a.mulik@gmail.com?subject=libsdp), or any other method with
the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Languages

* If you find a mistake in the documentation or don't understand something (my
English is very bad), write me an
[email](mailto:work.a.mulik@gmail.com?subject=libsdp_grammar), even if the
problem is in one single letter. Grammar Nazis are welcome here.
* In issue you can write both in English and in Russian (the first is
preferable, because more people will be able to understand you).
* You can write me an e-mail in the language that you know better.
* If you don't know either Russian or English, write me an e-mail in your
language - machine translation is better than translation of a machine
translation.

## About Co–°

There is no Code of Conduct in this repository, I'm too lazy to write it.
