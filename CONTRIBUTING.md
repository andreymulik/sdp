# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via [issue](https://github.com/andreymulik/sdp/issues),
[email](mailto:work.a.mulik@gmail.com?subject=libsdp), or any other method with
the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Issues

* Please write the version of the library in the issues.

## Merge requests

* Please don't do MR in master.
* If you offer functionality, make MR to `dev` branch or `sdp-%largest.version%`
(they must match).
* If you suggest fixes for already released versions, make an MR to the branch
of the latest MINOR release of the MAJOR version in which you have problems.
Example: there is a MAJOR version of `sdp-0.2`, a MINOR version of `sdp-0.2.1`
and a PATCH `sdp-0.2.1.1`, in this case you need to do MR in `sdp-0.2.1` as in
the latest and most relevant branch - the changes will be included in the
`sdp-0.2.1.2`. If changes affect several MAJOR releases, MR can be made to the
last MINOR version branch of any of them, further these changes will be applied
to all affected versions.

## Languages

* If you find a mistake in the documentation or don't understand something (my
English is very bad), write me an
[email](mailto:work.a.mulik@gmail.com?subject=libsdp_grammar), even if the
problem is in one single letter. Grammar Nazis are welcome here.
* In issue you can write both in English and in Russian (the first is
preferable, because more people will be able to understand you).
* You can write me an e-mail in the language that you know better.
* If you don't know either Russian or English, write me an e-mail in your
language - machine translation is better than translation of a machine
translation.

There is no Code of Conduct in this repository, I'm too lazy to write it.
