# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository
before making a change. Also see change.nx - this is a public version of TODO.

## Languages

* If you find a mistake in the documentation or vaguely understand the meaning
of what was written, write to me about this by e-mail. Even if the problem is in
one single article. Grammar Nazis are welcome here.
* In issue, you can write both in English and in Russian (the first is
preferable, because more people will be able to understand you).
* You can write me an e-mail (<work.a.mulik@gmail.com>) in the language that you
know better. If you are a Russian speaking developer and don't know how to
literary translate a certain term (e.g. "pattern matching" translates as
"сопоставление с образцом" - whis is ugly and too long), then write it in
English and don't use transliteration.
* If you don't know either Russian or English, write me an e-mail in your
language - machine translation is better than machine translation of a machine
translation.

## About CoС

Please note that there is no code of conduct. I'm in principle do not want
to limit anyone's freedom of speech (as part of a discussion on the topic).
If you insult someone, then this is your problem. If you take the opinion of
unfamiliars personally, this is your problem.
