DESCRIPTION:

change.nx is the file for changes that will be implemented in the dev branch.

This is a public version of TODO, without "grandiose intents" and momentary
"brilliant ideas". This is either what I'm working on now, or approved requests.

Don't write anything yourself if the request has been added to this file - with
the same functionality, I will usually prefer my own code.

VERSION NX (0.1.0.0):
  
  Set instances for some data structures.
