NOTE:
    This library is written for convenience only (primarily mine).
    The difference between the simultaneous use of vector, containers and other
  packages and the using SDP is the ability to work with different
  data structures in the same namespace and process them syntactically similar
  way through effective type classes, rather than heavy and/or too general.
    At the same time, the SDP does not attempt to replace any of the listed or
  implied packages.
    It provides only simple and natural interfaces to improve the interaction
  between different packages. And, of cource, some simple data structures,
  otherwise it would be a completely mindless compatibility layer.

version 0.0.0.1
  Initial development phase, not recommended for use.
